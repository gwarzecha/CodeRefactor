# CodeRefactor

The premise of this project was to refactor a basic website consisting of HTML and CSS. 
The purpose was to become more familiar and comfortable with increasing a web-page's
accessibility and improving an existing codebase for sustainability. This was 
accomplished by ensuring that the overall element structure within the HTML was logical, 
appropriately tagged, and flowed sensibly; ensuring that all links within the webpage directed
to the proper place, condensing CSS rules where appropriate, and ensuring that the page 
retained its aesthetics and intended functionality. 

Hurdles that I encountered while working towards this goal stemmed mainly from properly
floating elements within their respective container. After a great deal of trial and error
and frequent visits to the drawing-board, I was able to overcome the inital float issues. 

The end result that I achieved offers a more logical HTML structure, greater accessibility, 
less repetition in the CSS Stylesheet, while retaining the overall integrity of the mock-up.
